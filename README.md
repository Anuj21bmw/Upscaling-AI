TASK :: 
The primary goal of this assignment is to showcase your proficiency in developing an
advanced AI model capable of enhancing the quality of a video by upscaling its
resolution and reducing noise. Your task entails harnessing the capabilities of any
suitable and available model to achieve significant improvements in video quality,
particularly by increasing its resolution and eliminating unwanted noise.

OVERVIEW ::
Overview
This project demonstrates the enhancement of video quality by upscaling its resolution and reducing noise. The implementation utilizes the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) model. The project is designed to run in a Google Colab environment, leveraging TensorFlow and OpenCV.

Getting Started ::
Open the provided Google Colab notebook (Video_Enhancement_with_ESRGAN.ipynb).
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to install the required libraries, download the ESRGAN model, and define the video enhancement functions.
Replace the placeholder paths in the notebook with the actual paths for your input and output videos.
Code Structure
Video_Enhancement_with_ESRGAN.ipynb: The main notebook containing the code for video enhancement.
ESRGAN_4x_model/: Directory where the ESRGAN model files are stored after downloading.

Notes::
The provided ESRGAN model is an example. You may explore other models for better performance on your specific task.
Consider using smaller video clips for testing due to potential GPU memory constraints in Colab.
Respect copyright and licensing when working with videos.
